# AI Mock Interviewer 🤖🎤

A cloud-native AI-powered mock interview system that conducts timed interviews based on job descriptions and candidate CVs. Features real-time voice interaction, intelligent follow-up questions, comprehensive feedback, and hybrid local/cloud AI processing for optimal cost and performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: WebSocket-based live interviews with STT/TTS capabilities
- **JD/CV Analysis**: Advanced parsing and matching of job descriptions and candidate CVs
- **Intelligent Question Generation**: Context-aware questions based on role requirements
- **Adaptive Follow-ups**: Dynamic follow-up questions based on candidate responses
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Multi-dimensional scoring with personalized improvement plans
- **Hybrid AI Processing**: Local models for low-latency tasks, cloud LLMs for complex reasoning
- **Admin Dashboard**: System monitoring, prompt management, and analytics

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Microservices Design

The system is built with 12 independent microservices:
- API Gateway & Authentication
- JD-CV Processor
- Question Engine
- Dialog Manager
- STT/TTS Gateway
- Follow-up Decision
- Feedback Service
- Media Service
- Analytics Service
- Vector DB Service
- Admin Service
- Notification Service

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + Pydantic + asyncio
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Redis
- **AI Models**: Whisper.cpp, Coqui TTS, Ollama, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Loki
